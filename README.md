Project Description 
The  Internet,  vis-a-vis  Web  2.0,  has  transformed  business  communication.  It  is  now  a  de  facto  
platform  in  engaging  with  customers,  suppliers,  partners,  and  investors  in  the  dissemination  and  
exchange of knowledge and information. This class teaches the development of dynamic business 
applications using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, JQuery and HTML5. The open source 
nature  of  these  technologies  enabled  free  implementations  that  led  to  increase  in  popularity  as  
options  for  web  development.  The  hands-on  approach  of  this  class  instructs  the  construction  of  
server-side dynamic, databased-driven business applications including data collection, insertion and 
parsing, as well as front-end web page development and processing. Students are expected to enter 
the course with only basic computer literacy and a strong desire to learn.
